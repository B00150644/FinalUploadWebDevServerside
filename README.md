Started with HTML, laying out the structure of web pages. Then moved on to CSS for layout, giving them some style and organization. 
-Home HTML and CSS including interactive location map and across the board navbar header and footer.
-Reservation HTML and CSS
-SignUp HTML and CSS
-Login HTML and CSS
-Menu page (basic HTML)

Implemented user validation for all HTML forms to ensure data integrity and security. Including errors if payment is not filled out correctly.

Performed basis path and equivalence testing to check for bugs and ensure functionality across different scenarios. 

Added getters and setters to the registration page for smoother data management.
